I made a reddit bot that lets you know if someone is the imposter or not

u/botwasnotanimposter
### The bot replies to any comment that has a user tagged at first and any of the words

>
> ### sus
> ### vent
> ### imposter
>


and anything related to these words...
_Some valid commands are:_

>
> ### its u/username i saw him vent
> ### its u/username he vented infront of me
> ### u/username is an imposter im sure
> ### u/username is mega sus
> #### and more...
>

As of now the bot can respond to comments on any subreddit, all you have to do is make a commment
I would love to hear suggestions regarding the bot and/or features you think should be implemented in later versions!

**NOTE:** Since the account is new and barely has any karma, its being ratelimited for 8 minutes by reddit everytime it makes a comment. I would be so thankful if you guys could upvote the comment made by the bot in the comments below so that this stops happening lol
